# Football Database

The football tournament database is a single comprehensive database that captures the information about various leagues and cup tournaments throughout the world. It also encapsulates the information about various football teams, their players and the staff associated with the clubs. The sponsor information of both the clubs and the leagues is also maintained in the database. Additionally, the database also manages to store the data points about match officials who officiate various leagues and cups. The combination of leagues and tournament in the same entity tournament allows the database to dynamically capture the insights of both types of football competitions allowing for a more streamlined structure. 

The main goal of this project is to create a multifaceted database that captures all the relevant information related to a football club.
